      The most important thing to do when you first start your privacy journey is not to ask yourself "what can I do to protect my privacy?" but to instead ask "what can I *stop* doing to protect my privacy?"
      Most people throughout their lives have given out personal information without much thought by signing up for rewards programs at stores, ordering food online, and even providing a full social graph and timeline of life events on sites like Facebook.
      It's not your fault; sites are intentionally designed to entice you to provide personal information and many times the benefits seem to outweigh the cost.
      
      But I see a lot of people that see an ad for a VPN from their favorite YouTuber claiming to "protect your data" (gee, vague much?), essentially asking the viewer
      to pay this company to magically solve all their online privacy woes. I'm reminded of the countless "weightloss" products we're inundated with claiming to
      help you shed the pounds from the comfort of your couch.
      
      But we already know how to lose weight; eat healthy and exercise. So why do we fall for the scam? It's because we know the road to achieving our goals will be
      bumpy and difficult. We'd rather buy the illusion of solving our problems than take steps to actually fixing them. It won't be easy, but with this page, I'd like to give you some
      guidance and tell you some things I've learned through trial and error to help make the process a bit less painful.
